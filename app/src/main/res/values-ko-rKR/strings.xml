\nUnfortunately, this does not work on all phones because some phone manufacturers set their own lock screen wallpaper and won\'t let you change it.
\n\nMake sure to press \"Home screen and lock screen\", when you set the live wallpaper.
\n\nThe lock screen image should match the screen size. If it is larger than the screen, it will be scaled and centered.\n</string>
