A live wallpaper for Android 10+ that respects dark theme mode.

With this app you can set an image for light theme mode and another image
for the dark theme.
When the dark theme of the system is enabled or disabled, the wallpaper will be
changed automatically.

Instead of a different image you can also adjust the color, contrast and
brightness of your existing wallpaper image to make it darker.

It is possible to select different images for home screen and lock screen.

The "read storage" permission is required if you want to import your current
wallpaper image. Once you imported your wallpaper you can safely revoke the
permission. If you don't want to import you current wallpaper, you don't need
to grant this permission.
