A live wallpaper for Android that respects dark theme mode

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) â€¢ [View older releases](https://keybase.pub/cuzi/DarkModeWallpaper_bin/)

The app automatically changes the wallpaper when the dark theme is enabled or disabled.
You can set a different image for dark theme or change the color/contrast/brightness of
your image.

Also supports animated GIF and WebP animations.

This app requires Android 10 or a later version. If you are using an earlier version of Android, you may be able to
achieve a comparable experience by using MacroDroid, Tasker or a similar automation tool.

## Selecting images

There are three ways to load an image as a wallpaper:
*  the "Select Image" button in the app opens the new [Android photo picker](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/photopicker), its access is limited to the phone's gallery
*  tap on the preview image on the right and select the  "Select another image" to open the old photo picker
*  share the image from another app: open the image in the gallery or any file manager app and press "Share". There are four entries in the share menu: day / night / lockscreen day / lockscreen night
